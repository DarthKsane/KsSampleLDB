# KsSampleLDB
Sample LDB addon for WoW.

I decided to learn how to create LDB addons, but I couldn't find any sample dummy addon to start with. So I jumped into several LDB addons which I had and simplified code to "minimal working product".
This addon just shows tooltip text, tooltip message, and makes some updates with internal variables.

# Renaming
Change addon name in following files:
- KsSampleLDB.toc
- KsSampleLDB.lua
- locales\enUS.lua
- locales\ruRU.lua
